as long as i 
hold this office i will defend americas interests above all 
else but in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations 
we also realize that its in everyones interest to seek 
a future where all nations can be sovereign prosperous and 
secure america does more than speak for the values expressed 
in the united nations charter our citizens have paid the 
ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of 
many nations represented in this great hall americas devotion is 
measured on the battlefields where our young men and women 
we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return 
to a country that is not at war with itself 
at home we cannot remain a force for peace in 
the world if we are not at peace with each 
other as we send our bravest to defeat our enemies 
overseas  and we will always be protected we will 
be protected by god finally we must think big and 
dream even bigger in america we understand that a nation 
is only living as long as it is striving we

for the first time in this grand hall i addressed 
the threats facing our world and i presented a vision 
to achieve a brighter future for all of us should 
be to lower the cost of health insurance and that 
is what we are giving them so tonight i call 
on the congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that
